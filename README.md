Housing Occupancy Management Enterprise System (HOMES)

My name is Doug and I am currently working at the University of Minnesota Twin Cities Housing & Residential Life.
A long time ago, we worked on a RFP to purchase an enterprise system that would help us manage our buildings
and their residents. Like any other higher education institutions, we came up with the acronym above :-) Yes,
we found a system and is still using it today.

I have thought about this project for a long time and have designed many database schema for it but could never
find the time to write the application for these schema. It is not that I have a lot of free time now, but writing
this on my own time will help keep my programming skill sharp and allow me to explore the latest technology and 
trends out there. Will this be useful for somebody? That I do not know, but for me, it will help keep my skills 
sharp and more knowledgeable of the current and upcoming technology. Why did I chose this? At this time, this what
I know best. Maybe as I write this, there will be other GitHub projects that I will find interesting and may even be
able to help contribute to them. 

I do not expect this to move fast initially because I still have to set up my workstation at home to prep up 
this project. For me, a laptop is great for portability and convenient, but to do any serious work, I prefer a
workstation.

I found out that CodeIgniter 3.0 was released a few days ago.  This is a nice opportunity to start a project with it, I know it has been 2 years since I started this project :-)
