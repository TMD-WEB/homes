Housing Occupancy Management Enterprise System (HOMES)

My name is Doug and I am currently working at the University of Minnesota Twin Cities Housing & Residential Life.
A long time ago, we started an RFP to purchase an enterprise system that would help us manage our buildings
and their residents. Like any other higher education institutions, we came up with the acronym above :-)

I have thought about this project for a long time and have designed many database schema for it but could never
find the time to write the application for it. It is not that I have a lot of free time now, but writing this
on the side will help retain my programming skill and allow me to explore the latest technology and trend out
there. Will this be useful for somebody? That I do not know, but for me, it will help keep my skills sharp and
more knowledgeable of the current and upcoming technology.
